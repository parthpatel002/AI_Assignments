# AI_Assignments

This repo contains my solutions for assignments of on-campus Artificial Intelligence (BITS F444) course.

The assignments are focussed on the following topics:

1. Uninformed search techniques like BFS and IDS.
2. Informed search techniques like hill climbing and simulated annealing.
3. Game-Playing Algorithms: Min-max and Alpha-beta Pruning search.
4. Solving Constraint Satisfaction Problem using backtracking and AC3 algorithms.
5. Computing conditional probabilities in a Bayesian Network.

**Note**: Each assignment focusses on implementing the entire solution **from scratch**, with a strong emphasis on analysis of **space and time complexity** for each algorithm. Also, each solution contains a **graphical-user interface** for ease of use in choosing different options for running different algorithms.
